            <p>This is my personal website. I will use it to share some information about myself and some of my interests and projects.</p>
            <p>When I was waiting for the final marks of my masters degree in October 2020, I started teaching myself JS, HTML & CSS and was eager to put my new skills to the test by building and designing this website from scratch. While I am not necessarily a professional Web-Developer (anyone who is looking at this on a mobile device or has general knowledge about website responsiveness will be able to tell), I still really enjoyed the process and will keep learning and improving. Some other projects I worked on; like my masters project about Computer Vision & Deep Learning with CNNs in Python and more can be found under <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I will keep updating this site as I expand my experience and skills.</p>
