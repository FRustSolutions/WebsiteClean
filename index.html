            <p>This is my personal website. I will use it to share some information about some of my interests and projects.</p>
            <p>As a side project I taught myself JavaScript, HTML & CSS and designed this website from scratch. I am not necessarily a professional web-developer, but the process was fun and I will keep improving.</p>
            <p>My main focus however lies on Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

            <p>Some of the projects I worked on; like my masters project about Computer Vision & Deep Learning with PyTorch for Covid-19 detection on lung CTs and more can be found under <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I will keep updating this site as I expand my experience and skills.</p>
